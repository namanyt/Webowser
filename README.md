  <h1>Webrowser</h1> 

Webowser is a lightweight yet powerful web browser which runs just as well on little embedded computers named for delicious pastries as it does on beefy machines with a core temperature exceeding that of planet earth. And it looks good doing that, built on top of <code>Electron</code> and <code>React</code>. It aims to be fast, private, beautiful, extensible and functional.
